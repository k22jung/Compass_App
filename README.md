# Compass_App

This application uses the orientation sensor (combination of the magnetic field sensor and accelerometer) 
to compute the azimuth direction of the device and will point to magnetic North. Be sure not to locate 
the device near any external magnetic fields. If the pointer doesn't point in the correct direction,
be sure to calibrate the device by moving it in a figure-8.
